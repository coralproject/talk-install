Talk allows users to login using our own authentication system, or through their
Facebook login. Please provide your Facebook App details below in order to
attach this information to your installation. This data is not saved in this
installer.

If you don't have a Facebook App setup, please visit
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/register for instructions on how to
create an App. Note that you don't need a review as part of the login process,
as we don't use any extended permissions on Facebook beyond basic login.
