The upgrading process assumes that you select an existing Talk application. Not
all upgrades from all versions are supported, in the future this tool will be
capable of warning of incompatible version upgrades, but for the moment ensure
that you are only using this tool for minor version upgrades.

Major version upgrades require database migrations, which this tool is not
capable of running safely yet.
